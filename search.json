    "text": "The 2023 College Football Championship was an absolute blood bath. The TCU Horned Frogs came into the game with a record of 13-2 after a back and forth battle with the Michigan Wolverines. The Georgia Bulldogs were a perfect 14-0 after squeezing out a victory vs the Ohio State Buckeyes on a last second missed field goal.\nFans around the country settled in to their living rooms to watch the big game on January 9, 2023. TCU came out and punched first, but after that it was all Georgia. The Bulldogs scored 65 unanswered points on there way to become 2023 National Champions. Many wondered if TCU should have even been in the playoff in the first place over a team such as Alabama. Was Georgia just that good, or was TCU overrated?\nThere’s a well-known narrative that the SEC, the conference Georgia plays in, is a dominant conference in college football. They consistently have high ranked teams and usually a team from the SEC is in the championship. On the other hand, the Big 12, the conference TCU plays in, is known for it’s high scoring games and explosive offenses. Let’s take a look at look at where the Big 12 stands offensively and defensively.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.3.0      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\ngames <- read_csv(\"data/footballlogs22.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 1672 Columns: 54\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): HomeAway, Opponent, Result, TeamFull, TeamURL, Outcome, Team, Con...\ndbl  (45): Game, PassingCmp, PassingAtt, PassingPct, PassingYds, PassingTD, ...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message."
