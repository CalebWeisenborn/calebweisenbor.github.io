    "text": "The 2023 College Football Championship was an absolute blood bath. The TCU Horned Frogs came into the game with a record of 13-2 after a back and forth battle with the Michigan Wolverines. The Georgia Bulldogs were a perfect 14-0 after squeezing out a victory vs the Ohio State Buckeyes on a last second missed field goal.\nFans around the country settled in to their living rooms to watch the big game on January 9, 2023. TCU came out and punched first, but after that it was all Georgia. The Bulldogs scored 65 unanswered points on there way to become 2023 National Champions. Many wondered if TCU should have even been in the playoff in the first place over a team such as Alabama. Was Georgia just that good, or was TCU overrated?\nThere’s a well-known narrative that the Southeastern Conference(SEC), the conference Georgia plays in, is a dominant conference in college football. They consistently have high ranked teams and usually a team from the SEC is in the championship. On the other hand, the Big 12, the conference TCU plays in, is known for it’s high scoring games and explosive offenses. Let’s take a look at look at where the Big 12 stands offensively and defensively.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.3.0      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggalt':\n  method                  from   \n  grid.draw.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobHeight.absoluteGrob ggplot2\n  grobWidth.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobX.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n  grobY.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\ngames <- read_csv(\"data/footballlogs22.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 1672 Columns: 54\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): HomeAway, Opponent, Result, TeamFull, TeamURL, Outcome, Team, Con...\ndbl  (45): Game, PassingCmp, PassingAtt, PassingPct, PassingYds, PassingTD, ...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntotals <- games %>% \n         group_by(Conference) %>% \n  summarize(\n    TotalOffYds = sum(OffensiveYards),\n    TotalDefYds = sum(DefYards),\n    TotalOffAvg = mean(OffensiveYards),\n    TotalDefAvg = mean(DefYards\n                       )) %>%\n      mutate(\n        OffenseAvg = TotalOffAvg ,\n        DefenseAvg = TotalDefAvg\n      )\n\ntopoffense <- totals %>% top_n(5,wt=OffenseAvg)\ntopdefense <- totals %>% top_n(5,wt=DefenseAvg)\n\nbar1 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topoffense, aes(x=reorder(Conference, OffenseAvg), weight=OffenseAvg)) + \n  coord_flip()\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topdefense, aes(x=reorder(Conference, DefenseAvg), weight=DefenseAvg)) + \n  coord_flip()\n\nbig12 <- totals %>% filter(Conference == \"Big 12 Conference\")\n\nbar1 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topoffense, aes(x=reorder(Conference, OffenseAvg), weight=OffenseAvg), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=big12, aes(x=reorder(Conference, OffenseAvg), weight=OffenseAvg), fill=\"purple\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title=\"Top 5 conferences in offensive and defensive yards per game.\", subtitle = \"The Big 12 gains the 2nd most yards per game and allows the 3rd most.\",  x=\"\", y=\"Offensive Yards Per Game\", caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topdefense, aes(x=reorder(Conference, DefenseAvg), weight=DefenseAvg), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=big12, aes(x=reorder(Conference, DefenseAvg), weight=DefenseAvg), fill=\"purple\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(title = \"\", subtitle= \"\", x=\"\", y=\"Defensive Yards Per Game\",  caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Caleb Weisenborn\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2, ncol=1)  \n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, defense in the Big 12 sort of relates to Iowa and winning championships. It’s nonexistent. Teams in the Big 12 on average allow 402 yards per game and offenses average around 427 yards. The SEC offenses come in just behind the Big 12 at about 423 yards per game, but the defensive averages don’t even crack the top 5. This means that defenses in the SEC are tougher, but the offenses still find success, on average.\nAlthough, an argument can be made here. Does the amount of yards a team gives up or gains per game necessarily equate to how bad or good they are? Yes and no.\nYou could hypothetically give up 1000 yards per game and go undefeated. If you can score more points than the other team, you win. Where the problem lies is the quality of opponents you are playing. I could grab 11 random dudes and average 500 yards a game by myself if we were playing against toddlers.\nThankfully, Sports Reference calculates a number called SRS, or Simple Rating Score. SRS takes into account a teams strength of schedule and point differential. The key here is it is not just point differential in wins. So, teams gain SRS points by playing tough opponents and either winning, or losing. The closer the game in a loss vs a tough opponent, the more SRS points a team would receive. The more points a team wins by, the more SRS points a team would receive, especially if it is a tough opponent.\n\n\nCode\nmorecfb <- read_csv(\"data/more_cfb_data2.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 131 Columns: 17\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (2): School, Conf\ndbl (14): Rk, TotalW, TotalL, TotalWPCT, ConfW, ConfL, ConfWPCT, Off, Def, S...\nlgl  (1): Notes\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntcu <- morecfb %>% filter(School == \"Texas Christian\")\nga <- morecfb %>% filter(School == \"Georgia\")\nbama <- morecfb %>% filter(School == \"Alabama\")\nmi <- morecfb %>% filter(School == \"Michigan\")\nosu <- morecfb %>% filter(School == \"Ohio State\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=morecfb, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, size=TotalW), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=tcu, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, size=TotalW), \n    color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ga, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, size=TotalW), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bama, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, size=TotalW), \n    color=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=mi, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, size=TotalW), \n    color=\"yellow\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=osu, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, size=TotalW), \n    color=\"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.9877863) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept =-0.05610687) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=8, y=2, label=\"Good SRS, Good SOS\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=-8.5, y=-7.5, label=\"Bad SRS, Bad SOS\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=tcu, aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, label=School)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=ga, aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, label=School)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=bama, aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, label=School)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=mi, aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, label=School)) + \n  geom_text_repel(data=osu, aes(x=SRS, y=SOS, label=School)) + \n  \n     geom_encircle(data=tcu, aes(x=SRS-0.2, y=SOS+.25), s_shape=.01, expand=.0000000001, colour=\"red\") +\n\nlabs(\n    x=\"Simple Rating\", \n    y=\"Strength of Schedule\", \n    title=\"Wait, did TCU actually have a tough schedule?\", \n    subtitle=\"The data shows TCU had the toughest schedule amongst playoff contenders.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Caleb Weisenborn\",\n    size=\"Wins\"\n    ) +\n  \n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\ntext"
